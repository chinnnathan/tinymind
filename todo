Makefile for activation table gen.
Support depth > 1 for RNNs
Q-format saturate policy. Currently only rollover is supported since it happens by default.
Support different numbers of neurons in hidden layers. Currently all hidden layers must have the same number of neurons.
Finish classifier implementation. See branch.
Finish LSTM implementation. See branch.
Support large integers (e.g. __int128 from GCC or boost::multiprecision).
Detect LUT values below resolution and set to min. Maybe with some warning or something? Developer needs to know that accurracy could suffer.
